# Adam Sandler Wordle
### What is it?
A wordle clone where you are given audio and have to guess which Adam Sandler movie it is from.
### Tech Used
This application was made using Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Sqlite3
### Why?
I wanted to create a fun and easy web game that is playable and I really love Adam Sandler movies. So when I thought of the idea I had to run with it and I'm glad I did. It has given me lots of experience dealing with a small database and interacting with Client-Side code and Server-Side code. I also rather like the old school, "poorly put together" vibe of the website, I find it rather fitting.
